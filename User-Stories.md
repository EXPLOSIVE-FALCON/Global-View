#User Stories

### MVP
1. As a user, I want to see pictures from an event of interest (which I may have attended) so that I can see other views and perspectives than just my own pictures.
2. As a user, I want to see tweets from an event of interest (which I may have attended) so that I can learn about the experiences of others who attended the event.
3. As a user, I want to see news from an event of interest (which I may have attended) so that I can obtain a 'journalistic' account of an event of interest.
4. As a user, I want to see pictures, tweets and news consolidated on an 'event dashboard' so that I can save time.
5. As a user, I want this event dashboard to load as quickly and accurately as possible, so that I don't have to wait.
6. As a user, I want the process of inputting the time and place of an event to be simple, so that I don't have to do much to see an event.

### Additional Features
1. As a user, I want this event dashboard to work reliably whenever I use it (i.e. avoid hitting API rate limits), so that I can view the full event dashboard.
2. As a user, I want this service to accept a photo as input to render an event dashboard based on the photo's GPS field and timestamp, so that I don't have to remember where or when an event took place.
3. As a user, I want to share an event dashboard with my friends, so that they can see the event without entering any information.
4. As a user, I want to save events I've previously requested, so that I don't have to re-enter the event's location and time.
5. As a user, I want to see photos and news from many services, so that I can have a more comprehensive recollection of an event.
6. As a user, I want to pick and order which photo and news services that are rendered on my event dashboard, so that I can customize my event dashboard.
7. As a user, I want this service to accept a calendar entry as input to render an event dashboard based on the calendar entry's location and time, so that I don't have to re-enter this information.
8. As a user, I want to receive updates when new photos, tweets or news are added to an event I've saved, so that I don't have to remember to check the service myself.
9. As a user, I want to see a list of the most viewed events.
10. As a user, I want this service to be usable on my phone.
